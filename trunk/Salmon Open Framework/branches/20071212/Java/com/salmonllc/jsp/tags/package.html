This package contains the implementation of the tags in the Salmon tag library.<BR>
Generally you will not use these classes directly. Use them indirectly by placing custom tags inside a JSP page<BR>
One exception is if you want to create your own custom tag that behaves like the other Salmon tags in it does its processing via GUI components based on the ones in com.salmonllc.html.<br>
Generally the tag handler for this type of tag would extend com.salmonllc.jsp.tags.BaseEmptyTag.
