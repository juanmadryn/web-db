This package contains WML GUI components that are created through JSP custom tags. The custom tags create the component from the com.salmonllc.wml apackage, but because the nature of the JSP implementation is different from the standard servlet implementation, some components (especially containers) needed their own implementation to function properly from custom tags.<br>
In general you should not construct these components directly. Instead do it indirectly by placing the corresponding custom tags in a JSP Page. Every component in this package has a corresponding component in the com.salmonllc.wml. To dynamically create components in using Java code, use the classes in those packages instead.
